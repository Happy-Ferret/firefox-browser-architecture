# Firefox Browser Architecture

## Vision

Build the world’s best web browser

## Strategy

Our top priority is to plan for where we want to go, but if we just think 5 years out, we’ll miss the dragon on the doorstep. So we need to look from both angles:

1. Look forward from where we are now: Move faster
2. Look backwards from where we want to get to: Consciously plan our architecture

## Our Conclusions

* [Documenting our output](text/0001-documenting-output.md) looks at how we’re going to communicate with the rest of Mozilla.
* [Extracting Necko](text/0002-extracting-necko.md) considers whether it's feasible or worthwhile to extract Necko — Gecko's C++ networking library — for use as a standalone component.
* [XUL problems](text/0003-problems-with-xul.md) aims to list the different kinds of problems that exist with XUL.
* [XBL and Web Components](text/0004-xbl-web-components.md) compares some old Mozilla technology (XBL) with modern Web Components.
* [Firefox Data Stores Documentation](text/0005-firefox-data-stores.md) documents the existing data stores across all current Firefox platforms.

## Posts

* [Browser Architecture Update](posts/2017-07-27-browser-architecture-update.md) is the first of our newsletters, sent to [firefox-dev](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/forums/#firefox-dev) to keep everyone in the loop.
